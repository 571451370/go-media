Various Go libraries for multimedia stuff.

These libraries is for my personal projects, no API stability at all.

Windows note:
Install mingw and setup the include paths using the environment
variable CPATH for include paths.

For libraries, build them or use pre-defined like the ones
provided by SDL.

http://win-builds.org/doku.php also provides a relatively complete
set of prebuilt libraries though outdated.
